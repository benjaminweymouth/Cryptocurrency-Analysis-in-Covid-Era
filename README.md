## Topic of Research

We want to explore the correlation between the covid-era market trends on crypto, microprocessor shortage, meme stocks, and gold. Each group member will explore desirable investment choices during the covid-era. 

We have Through different data charts and plots, we will draw some conclusions patterns, and show whether there is strong or weak correlation. Positive versus negative news on certain date, and include news sources. What covid-era correlations can we determine from analyzing cryptocurrency markets as relating to microprocessor shortage, traditional assets (gold, lumber) and the introduction of meme stocks?
