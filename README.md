# Crypto and Covid: An analysis of cryptocurrencies and the financial markets during the covid era

### Project team members: Benjamin Weymouth, Mohamed Berrachdi, Sadia Akbar ###
-----------------------------
Our motivation is to understand how the covid pandemic affected market trends, volatility and correlations between various market forces in cryptocurrencies, commodities and the semiconductor industry. We will address the connection between cryptocurrencies, the covid pandemic, and various X-Factors: semiconductors, meme stocks and gold.

## Topic of Research

We sought to uncover the answer to these questions: is there a correlation between the performance of our X-Factor, cryptocurrency and the covid crisis? 
If an investor had a choice, should they have invested in an X-Factor or in cryptocurrencies based on pre and post covid performance? For our cryptocurrency, gold and the semiconductor industry analysis, we utilized Yahoo Finance. We looked at other commodities on finance but narrowed our scope and gained some momentum. For our data on the covid crisis, we turned to an internationally recognized body, the World Health Organization. We were able to find csv data on covid case numbers.
