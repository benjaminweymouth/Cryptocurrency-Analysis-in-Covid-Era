## Analysis
We have Through different data charts and plots, we will draw some conclusions patterns, and show whether there is strong or weak correlation. Positive versus negative news on certain date, and include news sources. (The NY Times, The Toronto Star, The Economist) 

## Question
What covid-era correlations can we determine from analyzing cryptocurrency markets as relating to microprocessor shortage, traditional assets (gold, lumber) and the introduction of meme stocks?
